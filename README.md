## PhD Project
This research aims to develop methods for calibrating asset models, where volatility depends solely on the asset's historical behavior, on vanilla option prices. These models are called PDV model. The objective is to create a model that not only accurately reproduces the prices of vanilla options but also captures the joint dynamics of the asset price and volatility. By doing so, this approach would enhance the pricing and hedging of more complex options.
